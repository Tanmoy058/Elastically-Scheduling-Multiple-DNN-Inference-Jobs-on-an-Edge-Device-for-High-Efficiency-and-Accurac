# Elastically Scheduling Multiple DNN Inference Jobs on an Edge Device for High-Efficiency and Accuracy
These are the source codes for the FLEX implementation. This is just a prototype and not ready for public use or production ready. 
To run the divided DNN models on the CPU, we used the Tensorflow framework, cross-compiled with Android Native Development Kit (NDK)  for Android smartphones.
